# Set Up Repos Folder on Mac/Linux

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for completing required setup tasks
on a computer running macOS or Linux.

All course repositories should be stored in a single folder named `Repos`
inside your local home directory.

## Task 1: Create `~/Repos` in Your Home Directory

Your home directory is:

- macOS: `/Users/<username>`
- Linux: `/home/<username>`

The `Repos` folder should be created directly inside your home directory and
should **not** be inside any cloud-synced location (such as iCloud Desktop or
Documents on macOS).

### Steps

1. Open **Finder** (macOS) or your file manager (Linux).
2. Navigate to your home directory:
   - macOS: `Go` → `Home` (or press **Command + Shift + H**)
   - Linux: Open your **Home** folder
3. Right-click (or Control-click) and select **New Folder**.
4. Name the folder **Repos** (capitalize the `R`).

### Verify

- Confirm the folder path is:
  - macOS: `~/Repos`
  - Linux: `~/Repos`
- Ensure the folder is **not** inside Desktop, Documents, or any synced folder.

## Task 2: Organize Repositories Inside `Repos`

Each GitHub repository you use will have its own folder inside the `Repos` directory.

### Verify

- Open the `Repos` folder.
- All cloned repositories should live directly inside this folder
  (for example: `~/Repos/applied-computing-foundations`).

## Task 3: Show Hidden Files and File Extensions

Hidden files (such as `.git`) are commonly used in computing and programming work
and must be visible.

### Steps

1. macOS: Press **Command + Shift + .** (period) to toggle hidden files.
2. Linux: Press **Ctrl + H** to show or hide hidden files in most file managers.

### Verify

- Navigate into any cloned repository.
- Confirm you can see hidden files such as `.git`.

## Task 4: OPTIONAL: Set File Manager Preferences

You may customize Finder or your file manager for easier navigation.

### Steps

1. macOS:
   - Open **Finder** / **Settings** (or Preferences) / **Sidebar**
   - Add your **Home** directory or **Repos** folder to the sidebar
2. Linux:
   - Adjust file manager settings to show hidden files by default, if desired

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Accidentally moved a file?**
  Use Finder's or your file manager's search feature to locate it.
