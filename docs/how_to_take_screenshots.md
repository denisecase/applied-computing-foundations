# How to Take Screenshots

## Screenshots on Windows

On Windows, use Snipping Tool or other similar app to select a rectangle (or window).
You can copy the screenshot to the clipboard and paste it, or save it as a file.

## Screenshots on Mac

On a Mac, use hot keys (several options):

- Copy the **Entire Screen** to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + **3**. This captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard.
- Copy a **Selected Portion** of the Screen to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + **4**. This allows you to select a portion of the screen to capture, and it will be copied to the clipboard.
- Copy a Specific **Window** to the Clipboard: Press Command (⌘) + Control (⌃) + Shift + **4, then press the Spacebar**. Move the camera icon over the window you want to capture, click, and the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard.
- **All options**: Press Command (⌘) + Shift + **5** to open the screenshot toolbar, which gives you several options.
